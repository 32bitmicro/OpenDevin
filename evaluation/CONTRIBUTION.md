# Contributing to OpenDevin-Eval (NeurIPS 2024 D&B)

DDL: May 29 (Anywhere on Earth)

Win some SWAG, and become a co-author of our upcoming evaluation paper. We aim to publish the results of our findings at the top conference (NeurIPS 2024 D&B). We have identified four ways to contribute:

## 🗃️ 1: Contribute a new dataset
For this segment, you open a PR in the OpenDevin repository where you create an implementation of a new task. Read more about how to add a dataset [here](./TUTORIAL.md).

## 📊 2: Contribute a new scores
Once we have the datasets, we want to evaluate models (close & open models) on them. We welcome evaluation scores for models, which will be added to the leaderboard.

## 🥸 3: Review PRs
We welcome reviews of PRs adding new datasets. If you wish to review PRs and provide feedback, please let us know

## ⛏️ 4: Architecture and Engineering
We are looking for contributors who can help us with the architecture and engineering of the evaluation. This includes improving the evaluation pipeline, adding new features, and fixing bugs.

## 😎 5: Important Support: sponsorship, providing insights
We are looking for sponsors to help us with the costs of running the evaluation. We also welcome co-authors who can help us write the paper. If you have insights or ideas that can help us improve the evaluation, we would love to hear from you.


## Authorship
We follow a similar approach as in the [SeaCrowd Project](https://github.com/SEACrowd#contributing-to-seacrowd) and use a point-based system to determine co-authorships. 

To be considered a co-author, at least 10 contribution points are required. The position of contributors in the author list is determined by the score they acquire, higher scores will appear first. If the scores are the same, sort by the first letter of the first name. 
If the top-ranked authors' contribution scores are very close, consider designating them as equal contributions.

To monitor how many points you have obtained, we recommend updating the score along with your PR. Past contributions also count. 

# Contribution point guideline
The contribution points are computed using the following table:

> **Note**: The purpose of the point system is not to barrier collaboration, but to reward contributions. We might adjust the point requirement lower to accommodate more co-authorship if needed.
